# TOON Specification

The TOON specification has moved to a dedicated repository: [github.com/toon-format/spec](https://github.com/toon-format/spec)

## Why a Separate Repo?

The specification has been moved to `toon-format/spec` to:

- Provide a canonical, language-agnostic source of truth
- Enable independent versioning of spec and implementations
- Support the growing community of TOON implementations across multiple languages
- Facilitate collaboration on spec evolution through a dedicated RFC process

## This Repository

This repository (`toon-format/toon`) remains the **reference implementation** in TypeScript/JavaScript. For specification discussions, issues, and contributions, please use the spec repository.
